This bash script is designed to analyze the log (log file) and generate a report containing all errors found.

## Usage

1. edit the script by specifying correct paths to the log file (`LOGFILE`) and the report file (`REPORTFILE`).
2. Save the contents of the script to a file, such as `log_error_report.sh`.
3. Make the file executable: `chmod +x log_error_report.sh`.
4. Run the script: `./log_error_report.sh`.

## Functions

The script contains the following function:

- `parse_log()`:
  - Analyzes the log file (`LOGFILE`), line by line.
  - For each line containing the word "error", adds that line to the report file (`REPORTFILE`).

## Result

After running the script, a report file (`REPORTFILE`) will be created with the following contents:

```
Error Report - <current date>
<error line 1>
<error line 2>
...
<error line N>
```

The report file will contain a header with the current date and all lines from the log file containing the word "error".

At the end of execution, the script will print a message:

```
Log analysis complete. Report generated at <path/to/file/report>.
```

## Notes

- Make sure that the specified paths to the log and report files are correct and read/write accessible.
- The script assumes that log errors contain the word "error". If your log uses other keywords for errors, you will need to edit the appropriate line in `parse_log()`.
- If the report file already exists, it will be overwritten with the new contents.
